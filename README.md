Airline Data Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze a decade-spanning airline dataset from 2010 to 2020, which encompasses over 7 million records. You can find the dataset on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sherrytp/airline-delay-analysis).

Key project highlights include:

- **Database Engineering**: Engineered a MySQL database to house the dataset, enabling comprehensive insights.
- **ETL Process**: Streamlined ETL processes to meticulously prepare, clean, and import raw data from various CSV datasets into the database, enhancing data quality and reliability through a rigorous 80% missing value ratio analysis.
- **Client Application**: Developed a sophisticated client application for administrators to access data through Complex Queries and Stored Procedures, utilizing Node.js, Express.js, and HTML for seamless backend and frontend interactions.
- **Security**: Ensured a secure MySQL server connection, optimizing data efficiency and security.
- **Machine Learning**: Deployed Python-based machine learning models and algorithms using NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for predictive analytics with high accuracy.
- **Development Methodology**: Applied Agile methodology for efficient development cycles.
- **Testing**: Conducted a comprehensive backend test suite with 16 tests utilizing Jest, assuring application reliability with a 100% pass rate.
- **Architectural Visualization**: Designed comprehensive ER diagrams with LucidChart for clear architectural visualization.
